Project description: Recipe CRUD
A CRUD application allows a user to create, read, update or delete selected data. For this project, you will build the interface of a food recipe CRUD app. The interface won't use a database or an API to store the data. Instead, it will require you to use React's useState() hook.

For detailed instructions on how to complete this project, consult the Instructions document in the Qualified assessment interface.
